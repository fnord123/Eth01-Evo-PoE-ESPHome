# ETH01-Evo config and other files for ESPHome

YAML and other files needed for using an ETH01-Evo board with PoE in conjunction with ESPHome.

Includes a basic yaml file along with other ones I've added for combining the base board
with various devices.

Note that as of February, 2025, these yaml files only work with dev builds of ESPHome.
